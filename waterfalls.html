          <h2>Athirappilly and Vazhachal Waterfalls in Thrissur</h2>

          <p>
            As you walk down the stone slabs that lead to the base of the
            Athirappilly waterfalls, a mysterious serenity overcomes you. It is
            Kerala's most famous and largest waterfall at over 80 ft high. The
            sight of the water crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense
            of wonder at the sheer power and magnificence of nature. Located
            around 63 km from Thrissur district, it is a perennial picnic spot
            for people in the area and beyond. Its surrounding greenery is
            perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the entrance
            to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River
            which calls the Western Ghats its home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Barely 5 km away is another family favourite, Vazhachal Waterfalls.
            These waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the
            endemic species found in the surrounding dense forests. Researchers
            have found four endangered species of the Hornbill here, the only
            place they thrive in the entire Western Ghats. Ornithologists attach
            great significance to this location and bird watchers can come
            across many rare and vibrant species in these parts.

            itself comes to a standstill.

            waterfalls is filled with the aroma of various plantations that are
            on every traveller’s wish list like arecanut, pepper, ginger and
            spices.

          <h2>Meenmutty Waterfalls, Wayanad</h2>

          <p>
            Imagine water crashing onto the ground from over 1,000 ft. in three

            patient, supporting audience. This and much more await you at
            Meenmutty Falls, one among Wayanad’s delightful treasures. It can be
            only accessed after an arduous 2 km jungle trek, the visuals on
            display at the summit are worth the effort. One has separate viewing
            points for each of the three decks of the waterfalls and due to its
            location this is one of the few natural wonders in the world that
            can be experienced in near seclusion. You feel at ease, while the
            lush greenery gently washes away all that ails your soul, as the
