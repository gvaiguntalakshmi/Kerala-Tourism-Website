          <h2>Vagamon in Idukki</h2>

          <p>
            Vagamon hill station in Idukki is among the few spots on the planet
            that need to be experienced first-hand to truly discover its glory.
            The grassy hills, velvet lawns and overall mysticism of the place
            cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world. This quaint town
            lies untouched by any modern influences and is neatly tucked away in
            Idukki district. Visitors can avail many activities including
            trekking, paragliding, mountaineering and rock climbing. People love
            travelling across a chain of three famous hills: Thangal, Murugan
            and Kurisumala. These are important to Hindus, Muslims and
            Christians, respectively, and are a perfect example of the communal
            harmony prevalent in the place. The Kurisumala monks have an
            enchanting dairy farm nearby that is an absolute delight to visit.

          <h2>Neelakurinji flowers on the hills of Munnar</h2>

          <p>
            Once every 12 years, the hills of Munnar turn blue. People flock in
            great numbers to view the blooming of the Neelakurinji. Biologists
            and nature loves alike mark their calendars for this great event
            that is expected next in 2018. The world awaits the turning of the
            Munnar range into a blanket of beautiful blue. It is easily among
            the most magnificent sights in the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            The flower has shown up in areas around Munnar like Mattupetty and
            Top Station. From August to October every 12 years, these areas are
            primed for viewing this natural wonder. 1600 m above sea level,
            Munnar is one of the most beautiful locations in Kerala and the
            world. Its tea plantations, hill ranges, plantation bungalows and a
            vast variety of rare flora and fauna have enthralled people for
            centuries. It is also home to the endangered Nilgiri Tahr whose
            population is currently being conserved at the Eravikulam National
            Park. One can even visit the Anamudi Peak, the tallest in South
            India, which has some of best trekking trails in the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            People love the view at Top Station, the highest point on the
            Munnar-Kodaikanal Route. Other places of interest in the area
            include Marayoor, Echo Point, Anayirankal and Valara Waterfalls. If
            kurinji is what gets you to Munnar, stay back and let this paradise
            on Earth take over your senses. It has never disappointed anyone who
            made the journey.

          <h2>Nelliyampathy Hills, Palakkad</h2>

          <p>
            From the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed
            peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to
            behold. The height of the hills ranges from 467 m to 1,572 m and it
            has an extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach
            Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that
            proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that
            have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating
            and is a nice option as a picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its
            way up to Nelliyampathy, at certain places there are viewpoints from
            where the vast stretches of Palakkad district are visible with its
            extensive paddy fields forming a verdant carpet. It also offers a
            splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a geographical
            phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing
            into view, parts of the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the way up, those interested in bio farming can take a close look
            at the privately managed farms and also vast expanses of tea estates
            managed by different plantation companies. The hills of
            Nelliyampathy are also well known for their orange cultivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Privately owned hotels and resorts are located at various points, as
            one goes up the hills of Nelliyampathy. The bio-farms located here
            are a major landmark as one proceeds up before reaching the topmost
            point at Palagapandi Estate. The estate has a quaint bungalow, built
            during the British rule in India, and has now been converted into a
            privately owned resort. At Kaikatty, a community hall is available,
            which is usually used as a base by those interested in trekking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not far away from Palagapandy is Seetharkundu where one can have a
            fantastic view of the valley and a 100-m high waterfall providing an
            added attraction. From Palagapandy, one can trek or go by jeep to
            reach Mampara — another breathtaking vantage point at Nelliyampathy.
            The area in and around Palagapandy Estate has tea, cardamom and
            coffee plantations with adjoining hills allowing one to catch a
            glimpse of the wildlife in the form of Indian Gaur, elephants,
            leopards, Giant Squirrel etc. and is also a paradise for
            birdwatchers.

          <h2>Nadukani Hills, Kottayam</h2>

          <p>
            Perched atop Nadukani, the mountains and the rivers seem like
            ancient beings, lying in deep slumber with a host of greenery on all
            sides as spectators. The bird’s eye view from this hill station in
            Kottayam is sought out annually by people numbering into the
            thousands. Nobody wishes to miss out on the panoramic view of
            mountain ranges on one side and that of the River Muvattupuzha on
            the other. Gigantic rocks are your companions, over 3000 ft. above
            sea level, and it is a visual worth embracing at least once in your
            lifetime.
