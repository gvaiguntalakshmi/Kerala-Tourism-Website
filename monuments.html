          The scenic backwaters of Kerala comprise serene stretches of lakes,
          canals and lagoons located parallel to the coast of the Arabian Sea.
          The backwater regions of Kerala are one of the most popular tourist
          destinations in the world. The tranquil backwater cruises are a once
          in a lifetime experience. Alappuzha, known as the 'Venice of the
          East', is especially popular for its houseboat cruises where you can
          soak in nature at its finest form.

          <h2>Bekal Fort</h2>

          <p>
            Kasaragod boasts of the largest and best preserved Fort in the whole
            of Kerala, bordered by a magnificent beach. Shaped like a giant
            keyhole, the historic Bekal Fort was built in the 17th century. This
            historic monument offers a superb view of the Arabian Sea from its
            tall observation towers, which were occupied by gigantic cannons
            till afew centuries ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Near the Fort is an old Mosque that is said to have been built by
            Tipu Sultan of Mysore. Originally constructed by the rulers of the
            ancient Kadampa Dynasty, the Fort changed hands over the years to
            the Kolathiri Rajas, the Vijayanagara Empire, Tipu Sultan and
            finally, the British East India Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, the Bekal Fort and its scenic surroundings are fast becoming
            an international tourist destination and a favourite shooting locale
            for film makers. Visiting hours: 08:00 - 17:30 hrs.

          <h2>Vizhinjam Rock-Cut Cave</h2>

          <p>
            Considered to be the smallest rock-cut shrine in southern India, the
            Vizhinjam Rock-cut cave is dated to back to 8th century. The shrine
            has a central cell with an independent sculpture of Dakshinamurthy
            and on either side of the cell are unfinished sculptures of Siva and
            Parvathi. It is believed to be one of the earliest rock-cut cave
            temples in Kerala. This rock cut cave is now a protected monument
            under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India since 1965.

            <strong>Temple Timings:</strong> 09:00 - 18:00 hrs. It remains
            closed on Mondays.
