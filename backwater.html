      <h1>Backwater</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          The scenic backwaters of Kerala comprise serene stretches of lakes,
          canals and lagoons located parallel to the coast of the Arabian Sea.
          The backwater regions of Kerala are one of the most popular tourist
          destinations in the world. The tranquil backwater cruises are a once
          in a lifetime experience. Alappuzha, known as the 'Venice of the
          East', is especially popular for its houseboat cruises where you can
          soak in nature at its finest form.

          <h2>Alappuzha</h2>

          <p>
            Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed
            an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is
            famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine
            products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic
            spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years
            old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the
            attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby
            which greatly intrigues all visitors. Another delightful experience
            while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find
            in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the
            Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word,
            ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In
            the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers
            over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices. Of
            late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel
            room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living
            rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted
            view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a
            houseboat.

          <h2>Kuttanad - the Rice Bowl of Kerala</h2>

          <p>
            Kuttanad, the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala’, lies at the very heart of the
            backwaters in Alappuzha district. Its wealth of paddy crops is what
            got it this unique nickname. Based in the inner regions of the
            district, it is a huge area of reclaimed land, separated by dikes
            from water which is higher than it appears. The view of the
            countryside is what enchants all who pass through this area while
            travelling via houseboats. It has been speculated that it is perhaps
            the only place in the world where farming is done up to 2 meters
            below sea level. The area is serviced by 4 major rivers: Pampa,
            Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Alappuzha - Changanassery Road that passes through the heart of
            Kuttanad is famous for itsscenic view of this locale. One gets to
            view a slice of the traditional country lifestyle. Visits to these
            villages can be a life changing experience. Especially during the
            harvest season, one finds farmers working in the fields most of the
            day. The early hours of the day brings to us the sight of women
            carrying sickles to the fields while men are busy sowing seeds and
            getting rid of weeds. Fields with rice stalks have legions of
            parrots hovering around them. One may also see darter birds flying
            around as they are known to be around the area surrounding the
            backwaters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The canals that crisscross Kuttanad are home to tall coconut trees
            that sway with the breeze. One sees ducks quacking around as youths
            dive into the water to hunt for shells. Some of the tastiest cuisine
            can be found at the shacks nearby and if you feel like it, do ask
            for toddy. It is a native alcoholic beverage that is extremely
            popular in the area.

          <h2>Kavvayi Backwaters</h2>

          <p>
            Kavvayi Kayal is among the most fascinating backwater destinations
            in Kerala. This lesser known destination is the result of the five
            rivers viz. River Kavvayi and its tributary streams Kankol,
            Vannathichal, Kuppithodu, and Kuniyan. Kavvayi refers to a
            collection of small islands connected to Payyannur in Kannur by a
            bridge. It has been bestowed with many a natural gift and is
            considered among the most exotic locations in North Kerala.
          </p>
          <p>
            These backwaters form the biggest wetland in north Kerala with an
            area of roughly 37 sq km. Boat rides provide one with the
            opportunity to watch the simple villagers go about their daily
            duties diligently. One comes across rare flora and fauna regularly.
            The boat rides will also help you explore each of the different
            islands. One can also indulge in delicious seafood in the area. It
            is the perfect place to visit for some well-deserved peace and
            relaxation. The breeze alone will calm your soul.
