          <h2>Nilambur Teak Plantation in Malappuram</h2>

          <p>
            Located 2 km from Nilambur town in Malappuram district is the oldest
            teak plantation in the world. Formed in the 1840s, it is spread
            across a huge area of 2.31 hectares. It was named after its creator,
            H.V. Conolly, the collector of Malabar district at the time. Chanthu
            Menon, who played a major role in developing this plantation, is
            buried here as well. He organised the hectic task of planting the
            saplings.
          </p>

          <p>
            The oldest teak tree in the world, Kannimari, is located here. The
            tribals of the area consider it sacred and people regularly flock to
            this place to look at this natural wonder. It is among the gems of
            the State’s plantations. At a distance of 4 km from the town lies
            the world's first Teak Museum. The museum is a sub-centre of the
            Kerala Forest Research Institute. The ground floor is dedicated to
            the study of the Kannimara Teak. This species is the oldest
            naturally growing variant in the country.

          <h2>Aqua Tourism in Kollam</h2>

          <p>
            Among the oldest ports in the Southern region, Kollam sees about a
            third of its area covered by the picturesque Ashtamudi Lake. The
            eight hour trip between Kollam and Alappuzha contains some of the
            most coveted visuals in God’s Own Country and is also the longest
            backwater cruise in the State. Once a major hub of international
            spice trade, it is the de facto leader in the cashew trading and
            processing industry in India. Today it has a plethora of Aqua
            Tourism options that enamour visitors throughout the year.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rustic seaside village of Thangasseri Beach is famous for its
            historical sites, including a Portuguese fort and churches built in
            the 18th century. Its lighthouse is yet another quaint attraction
            here. Thirumullavaram Beach is a peaceful and secluded shoreline
            connected to Kollam town. One can never forget the Alumkadavu
            Backwater that is situated 23 km from Kollam and is well known for
            its boat building yard. The gigantic kettuvallams (cargo crafts of
            rural Kerala), which would eventually be turned into houseboats,
            were built here.

          <h2>Aranmula – the Heritage Village in Pathanamthitta</h2>

          <p>
            Visitors to Pathanamthitta district are never really sure of what to
            expect from Aranmula. This is mostly due to the lore surrounding
            this exotic village, famous for the genius of its craftsmen and the
            ancient vibe one experiences the moment oneenters. Aranmula is
            famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old
            Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’
            and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on.
          </p>

          <p>
            It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy
            Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River
            Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and
            paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the
            venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity
            Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are
            offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the
            largest vegetarian feasts in India. (Watch the video of Vallasadya)
          </p>

          <p>
            Its legendary Vijnana Kalavedi houses some of the finest classes and
            teachers for a variety of art forms like Kathakali, classical
            dances, classical music and Kalaripayattu. Visitors can stay here
            for an extended period and observe the ancient crafts being passed
            on diligently to the next generation.
          </p>

          <p>
            A trip is never complete without obtaining one of its special metal
            mirrors- the beautiful Aranmula Kannadi. From being gorgeous
            souvenirs to exquisite wedding gifts, these are unique to this
            locale and haven't yet been replicated anywhere else in the world.
