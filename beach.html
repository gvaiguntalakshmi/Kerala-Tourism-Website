          <h2>Kovalam Beach</h2>

          <p>
            Kovalam is an internationally renowned beach with three adjacent
            crescent beaches. It has been a favourite haunt of tourists since
            the 1930s. A massive rocky promontory on the beach has created a
            beautiful bay of calm waters ideal for sea bathing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leisure options at this beach are plenty and diverse.
            Sunbathing, swimming, herbal body toning massages, special cultural
            programmes and catamaran cruising are some of them. The tropical sun
            acts so fast that one can see the faint blush of coppery tan on the
            skin in a matter of minutes. Life on the beach begins late in the
            day and carries on well into the night. The beach complex includes a
            string of budget cottages, Ayurvedic health resorts, convention
            facilities, shopping zones, swimming pools, Yoga and Ayurvedic
            massage centres.
          </p>
          <p>

            star hotels to budget hotels and the choice of food available at
            restaurants and cafeterias range from Continental varieties to South
            Indian delicacies.

            Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, is just 16 km away

            holiday it is better to stay in Kovalam and visit the city. The city
            of Thiruvananthapuram has many interesting places to see like the
            Napier Museum, the Sri Chitra Art Gallery and the Padmanabhaswamy
            Temple. The SMSM Institute, a State owned handicrafts emporium, is
            the ideal place to pick up ethnic curios and other articles.

          <h2>Kappad beach</h2>

          <p>
            Kappad Beach has historically played an important role in the
            history of Kerala. On these shores, over 500 years ago in 1498, 170
            men led by Vasco- da-Gama first stepped onto Kerala. The entire
            State, especially the Malabar Coast, would never be the same again.
          </p>

          <p>
            A visit to Kozhikode is incomplete without a visit to this legendary
            site. The spice route flourished through this Beach. A walk in and
            around the place gives one an idea of itshistorical relevance. The
            rocks and small hills add to its charm. The nearby shacks are always
            stocked with excellent local delicacies and tea. Migratory birds can
            be spotted occasionally as well. Kappad Beach is a truly majestic
            destination, which will always hold an important place in our
            history.
